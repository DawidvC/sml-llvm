## sml-llvm - Standard ML bindings for LLVM

_Copyright 2010-2014, Martin Elsman_

This repository contains a port for Standard ML (in particular, the
MLKit) of the OCaml bindings for [LLVM](http://llvm.org).

The repository also contains a port of an example by Jon Harrop for
compiling a miniml language into LLVM. See [test/miniml](/test/miniml) and
http://groups.google.com/group/fa.caml/msg/5aee553df34548e2

### Assumptions

The library works with a 32bit installation of [LLVM](http://llvm.org) and the native
[MLKit](http://melsman.github.io/mlkit) compiler.

### LICENSE

The library is distributed under the MIT License; see the [LICENSE
file](/LICENSE) for details.
